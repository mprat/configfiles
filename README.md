configfiles
===========

Configuration files for things like vim and monitors, etc.

## Usage

Before using these files you need to install `rake`:

```
sudo apt install rake
```

(or whatever equivalent for OSX or Windows - we're using WSL on Windows so it should be the same instructions as for Linux)

To actually do the setup and installation:

```
rake WHATEVER_TASK
```
